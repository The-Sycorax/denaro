# Denaro Node Container Entrypoint
#
# Overview
#   This script launches a Denaro node inside a container. It prepares runtime
#   configuration, optionally acquires a public URL via Pinggy, coordinates
#   bootstrap peer discovery through a registry file, ensures the node-specific
#   PostgreSQL database exists and has the required schema, then starts the
#   Denaro node process.
#
# Lifecycle and responsibilities
#   1. Initialization:
#        - The shared peer registry directory is created
#        - A deterministic database name and internal self URL is derived.
#        - Bootstrap intent is normalized when unset.
#
#   2. Public URL acquisition and publication:
#        - If tunneling is enabled, a reverse tunnel is extablished via `ssh` 
#          using Pinggy's free tunnleing service (free.pinggy.io).
#        - The tunnel output is parsed to capture the public HTTPS URL.
#        - The captured URL is written to the shared registry file for peer discovery.
#        - If capture fails, the internal URL is retained and tunneling is disabled.
#
#   3. Peer discovery:
#        - Public bootstrap nodes wait for the appearance of another public peer.
#        - Private nodes in discovery mode wait for any public node.
#        - A peer URL that is not the current node is selected when available.
#        - If a timeout occurs or no peer is available, the bootstrap target is
#          set to `DENARO_SELF_URL` .
#
#   4. Env generation, database provisioning, and application launch:
#        - An application `.env` file is generated with the required variables.
#        - PostgreSQL readiness is awaited.
#        - The node database is created if it does not already exist.
#        - The schema is imported only on first database creation.
#        - Finally, the Denaro node is started via `python run_node.py``.
#
# Inputs via environment:
#   NODE_NAME                   Name of this node
#   DENARO_NODE_HOST            Hostname or IP the node binds to or advertises
#   DENARO_NODE_PORT            Port that the node listens on inside the container
#   ENABLE_PINGGY_TUNNEL        When "true", Pinggy tunneling is enabled to expose
#                               the node on the Internet.
#   DENARO_BOOTSTRAP_NODE       "self", "discover", or any explicit URL
#   DENARO_DATABASE_HOST        Hostname of the database service
#   POSTGRES_USER               Database user
#   POSTGRES_PASSWORD           Database password
#
# Outputs and artifacts:
#   - A registry file at /shared/registry/public_nodes.txt contains public URLs when available.
#   - A .env file is written in the working directory for the application runtime.
#   - A PostgreSQL database named "denaro_<sanitized node name>" is created if absent.
#
# Fallback strategy and exit behavior:
#   - The script is designed to be resilient and avoid exiting on recoverable issues.
#   - Tunnel failure does not cause exit. The internal URL is used and tunneling is disabled.
#   - Discovery timeout does not cause exit. The bootstrap target becomes self.
#   - Absence of a different public URL does not cause exit. The bootstrap target becomes self.
#   - Database or unrecoverable runtime errors may still cause exit due to `set -e`.
